## Functionality
On first visit, the user lands on the page and is given instructions on how to user the UK weather search.

A user can search for a city in the UK, and on click of the search button the page displays today's weather information, including:
- temperature
- humidity
- wind speed
- UV index

Below that also displays a 5 day forecast of the generic forecast for that day.

Each forecast is also accompanied with an icon to indicate the day's forecast.

When the user searches for a city's forecast, it also adds the city to the user's search history.

The search history is clickable, which allows a user to click on one of their last 7 searches and see the weather information for that day again.

The system is based on local storage, so when someone revisits the page (as long as they've not removed the information from their local storage) then their search history will continue to display.
